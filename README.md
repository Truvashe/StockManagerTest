This is one of the personal projects i'm interested in completing this summer;

The objective is to ceate both a web and a desktop application focusing on stock managing products and making cashiers life easier by automating some manuall work.
I've almost finished with the web part and now I'm attacking the desktope part.

This whole thing should make me somewhat familliar with the following aspects :
  Coding Languages : HTML/JAVASCRIPT/PHP/C#/XML
  Using Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code
  Debugging web application
  Database management using MySQL
  Depression
  Understanding how multiple files can work with each others and how to connect them to
  Some aspects of cyber security (I am aware that both the web and desktop application are as safe as a child with a minecraft youtuber)
  Using ChatGPT efficently and actually learn from it
  Learning/looking up stuff via internet by myself
  The totalitty of the lyrics in the weezer 1994's album
  and how to use GitHub

This Desktop app will be Open-Source until it's good enough to sell (if it ever get good enough to sell)

Be free to give me suggestions or comments unless it's useless
